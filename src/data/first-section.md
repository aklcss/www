# 🏡 HOME OF AUCKLAND CSS
## Your friendly neighborhood meetup <br /> (=^･ｪ･^=))ﾉ彡✨

Frontend Development has gone bonkers. And the things people are doing in the browser these days without reliance on backend systems is quite frankly ridiculous. This group is for people who want to learn and share the cool things they are doing regarding HTML & CSS (maybe a touch of JS for those old browsers that cant keep up).

We're the group that loves to break the status quo and foster community above all else.

Come and get inspired, learn some tricks & share some of your own, and meet others in the industry with whom you may make lifelong friends.
