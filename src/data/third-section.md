## ðŸ”Œ CONNECT

Join the conversation on [Slack](http://auklandcss.herokuapp.com/) where we share links and chat about all things in CSS and in-between.

[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-css/) is our portal to all things event related. You can find a history of our previous talks with photos and descriptions.

We don't use the Twitter much but others do so use [#aklcss](https://twitter.com/hashtag/aklcss?src=hash) to stay in the loop.

This site is a work in progress, currently made with [Gatsby.js](http://gatsbyjs.org/).<br /> Repo open for PR's [here](https://github.com/aklcss/www)
