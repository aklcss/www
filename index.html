                    <h3><a href="http://talks.pixelastic.com/slides/algolia-auckland-css-2017/">A Search Engine in Pure CSS</a></h3>
                    <p><strong>Tim Carry</strong> of Algolia aka @pixeltastic<br/>On March 31st, we announced our CSS API Client, that replicated a search engine with only CSS. While it was only a joke in the spirit of April Fool’s, it was a lot of fun to make, and also a lot of fun to see it in the wild.</p>
